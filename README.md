# Olive Oil Origin Smart Contract

This project provides a **traceability solution** for olive oil batches, allowing producers, importers, and retailers to securely track the origin and movement of batches from production to final delivery. Built on Ethereum, this Solidity smart contract enforces access control, ensuring only authorized roles can update and view sensitive batch history.
